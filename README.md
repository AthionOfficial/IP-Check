IP-Check
========
Current Build: **1.3.3**  
##What is IP-Check?
IP-Check is a server plugin designed to alert you (server administrator) and your staff about players with mutliple accounts on your server. It helps to notify you of possible situations, and helps with you getting of these "multi-accounters".  
##How does IP-Check work?
In it's current state, IP-Check operates in a very simple way. Utilizing either the widely known Essentials plugin for Bukkit, or it's own backend manager, IP-Check logs every player that ever joins your server, and logs their current IP address. When the player logs in, IP-Check immediately performs a background check, comparing the IP Address of the player to it's database, and alerting you if a certain number (or higher number) of matches are found.  
With one simple command, IP-Check can provide you with a list of every account that is tied to a player, and also let you know if the person has been banned or is exempt from (background) checking.  
##How can I get IP-Check?
IP-Check is available for download on Dev Bukkit, or, if you're feeling ambitious, you can download and play with the source code on Github.
We also have a continious integration server running, so you can fetch latest builds from the master branch at http://ci.bam.yt/view/Others/job/IP-Check/ .
##Current Features
In it's current state, IP-Check comes with the following features:  
   * Logging of players and their IP Addresses for the prevention and detection of mutli-accounters.  
   * Background checking of players to alert you when a multi-accounter is on your server.  
   * Exemption capabilities to allow players to go unchecked (and prevent unnecessary spam in your chat. :))  
   * MySQL Support for backend usage.  
   * SQLite Support for backend usage.  
   * Much more!  

##Upcoming Features
We've got some pretty advanced features lined up for our 1.3.x release. In fact, we're receiving the help of a few net-savvy friends in helping up with the new features. Here's some of the stuff we've got planned:  
   * A centralized network-accessable control panel for plugin/overall server management.  
   * A detailed logging system. 
   * Ability to manage players and perform plugin related tasks on them remotely from the new C-Panel.  
   * Hotdog Vendor.

Q: How does the internet help globalization and world markets especially for small business?

A: It gives everyone access to the business. Anyone who has access to the internet can have access to the business, and for businesses which are local only, this allows for increased presence in the world, even if only by a small margin.

Q: How to convince local businesses to invest?

A: inform them of the circumstances under which were building the drive-in theater, how it's only the second one anywhere near us. Explain how that fact would make people who don't live very close to Bloomberg (or wherever/whatever the place is) want to come to Clinton instead. That would help our popularity and bring in more money for the town, because people would be tempted to buy at the town's stores and restaurants while they're here. Explain that our drive-in would provide employment opportunities for local residents, and that the money would go back into the town. Plus, drive-ins aren't very costly to build and maintain compared to a conventional theater, and have a nostalgic feel that would be a good fit for our small town. Finally, the theater would do wonders for the town during the Little Italy Festival, because people would be tempted to stick around town longer to catch a showing in the evening, and that would cause them to buy more / give more money to local business.
